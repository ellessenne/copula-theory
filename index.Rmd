# Introduction {#introduction}

Copulae are commonly referred to as _functions that join or couple multivariate distribution functions to their one-dimensional marginal distribution functions_; a formal definition of copula functions is introduced in Chapter \@ref(theory).

This short `bookdown` book covers basic principles of copulae, Archimedean copulae, and estimation methods (focussing on full maximum likelihood estimation).
Throughout this document I will focus on bivariate copulae (i.e. for bivariate outcomes), but most (if not all) of the theory outlined here generalises to any number of dimensions.
