Let \\((X_1, X_2)\\) be a bivariate random vector with continuous marginal distributions; this implies that the marginal cumulative distribution functions [CDFs] \\(F_i(x_i) = P(X_i \\le x_i)\\) are continuous functions as well. By applying the probability integral transform, the random vector \\((U_1, U_2) = (F(X_1), F(X_2))\\) has marginals that are uniform on the interval \\([0, 1]\\): this corresponds to the definition of copula that was introduced above. Therefore, the copula \\(C\\) of \\((X_1, X_2)\\) is defined as the joint CDF of \\((U_1, U_2)\\): \\[ C(u_1, u_2) = P(U_1 \\le u_1, U_2 \\le u_2) \\] More formally, \\(C: [0, 1]^d \\rightarrow [0, 1]\\) is a \\(d-\\)dimensional copula if \\(C\\) is a joint CDF of a \\(d-\\)dimensional vector on the unit (hyper-)cube \\([0, 1]^d\\) with uniform marginals.
